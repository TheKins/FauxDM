MISC. CHANGES:
- Minor sound improvements

BUILD 05.1 (June 25th 2022)
===========================

MONSTER CHANGES:
- Added a few more dumbass names to the list.

MISC CHANGES:
- Fixed the mod not starting in GZDoom 4.8.0.

BUILD 05 (March 28th 2021)
==========================

MONSTER CHANGES:
- Added AI Redirector actors! These invisible actors will cause monsters to snap
  in a certain direction upon touching them under certain circumstances, allowing
  level designers to tell monsters to stay on bridges and walkways if need be.
- Monsters will now actively attempt to get out of pools of water.
- Monsters can now jump over level geometry that's too big to step up, but small
  enough for players to jump over.
- Monsters will now print obituaries when killed, just like humans do. If you
  don't appreciate the console spam, this is togglable in the DM Sim menu.

MAP CHANGES:
- DUST: Added an old favorite from Counter-Strike!
- FDM03: Added AI redirectors.
- FDM03: Added additional detail outside of the playable area.
- FDM04: Added AI redirectors.
- FDM05: Added AI redirectors.
- BB3: Added AI redirectors.
- D5M1: Re-added holiday version as D5M1X (see Misc. Changes)

WEAPON CHANGES:
- Flamethrower: Imported updated version of Flamethrower library from Reelism 2.

MISC. CHANGES:
- Added a CVAR to re-enable Holiday-themed content, so that I don't have to
  remember to shove out another release next December. You can turn on this
  content in the DM Sim menu. Content for other holidays may be added in the
  future, but probably won't.
- Added and improved the sound clips for match stats and Gauntlet kills.
- Added widescreen intermission border from MetaDoom.
- Updated certain system artworks to support widescreen.
- Fixed FDM Options not appearing in Simple Options Menu.

- Fixed duplicate item definitions in UDB by changing how Skulltag actors are
  replaced by FDM counterparts and/or removed
- Replaced old hack for making MP items appear in single player with the nice
  new "SpawnMulti" skill setting flag. Hooray, engine-level functionality!
- Fixed a bug where, when dying under certain odd circumstances, players wouldn't
  actually enter their death state. Plasma Rifle splash damage suicides were
  notorious for this.
- Continued development of the Fake Voice Chat system. (maybe this'll ship some day)

BUILD 04 (September 5th 2020)
=============================
I kind of dropped this mod in January to go back to MetaDoom and totally forgot
to kick this release out there. Better late than never!

GAMEPLAY CHANGES:
- Added the ability to play on deathmatch maps that don't have a player 1 start!
- Rewrote the code to make multiplayer-only actors appear in single player to not
  mangle actor flags, allowing script actors to function properly. As such, the
  CVar to toggle this behavior has been removed.
- Added Duke3D-style respawn markers! Togglable in the DM Sim Options menu.

MONSTER CHANGES:
- General: Monsters that aren't fighting the player will switch targets to the
  player if they get reasonably close and aren't actively fighting someone else,
  reducing the common issue of monsters running past the player seemingly
  oblivious to their existence.
- Pacifist: Added to the Hard spawn list!
  
MAP CHANGES:
- Made some tweaks to IWAD maps (E1M8, MAP01, MAP02, MAP32)
- BB3: Added a favorite map from Blood!
- FDM02: Adjusted temple geometry to make the Timesphere jump easier.
- FDM03: Adjusted scripting for slanted jumppads to remove workarounds.
- FDM04: Replaced the hidden Hastesphere with a Timesphere.

MISC. CHANGES:
- Added more sound clips for the start of a match.
- Continued development of the Fake Voice Chat system. (removed in stable release)
- Fixed animation on Bossbrain projectile explosions
- Fixed some intermission issues on newer versions of GZDoom.

BUILD 03.1 (January 3rd 2019)
=============================

MONSTER CHANGES:
- Santa: Removed from the spawn lists.

MAP CHANGES:
- FDM05: Removed holiday spirit.

MISC. CHANGES:
- Fixed issue where monsters would not spawn on maps that originally had more
  than 50 monsters in vanilla gameplay. Derp.

BUILD 03 (December 18th 2019)
=============================

MONSTER CHANGES:
- General: Monsters can now trigger "Sector Action: Actor Hits Floor" actors that
  are set up to be effected by players, since these are commonly used to kill or
  teleport players that go out of bounds. This is togglable in the DM Sim menu.
- ????? ????: Added to the Hard spawn list! Merry Wednesday!
  
ITEM CHANGES:
- Time Sphere: Added as an Area Map replacement! Replaced by HasteSphere in multi.

- Removed duplicate Rocket Launcher sprites.
- Explosive Barrels now have their original delay before exploding.
- Timer is no longer visible when HUD is disabled.
- Converted Jimmy's smallfont to the modern Unicode font format, making it play
  nicer with custom mapsets that override the smallfont.
- Respawn/Teleport fog looks a little nicer, and has a different sound when
  teleporting instead of respawning.
- Laid a bit of groundwork for the Fake Voice Chat system (removed in stable release)
- Moved most monster/key removal to an event handler for greater universality.
- Added a proper CREDIT graphic.

GAMEPLAY CHANGES:

  every time a level is completed, via the DM Sim menu.
