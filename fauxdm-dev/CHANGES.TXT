  in a certain direction upon touching them under certain circumstances, allowing
  level designers to tell monsters to stay on bridges and walkways if need be.

  don't appreciate the console spam, this is togglable in the DM Sim menu.

BUILD 04 (September 5th 2020)
=============================

to kick this release out there. Better late than never!

GAMEPLAY CHANGES:
- Added the ability to play on deathmatch maps that don't have a player 1 start!
- Rewrote the code to make multiplayer-only actors appear in single player to not
  mangle actor flags, allowing script actors to function properly. As such, the
  CVar to toggle this behavior has been removed.
- Added Duke3D-style respawn markers! Togglable in the DM Sim Options menu.

MONSTER CHANGES:
- General: Monsters that aren't fighting the player will switch targets to the
  player if they get reasonably close and aren't actively fighting someone else,
  reducing the common issue of monsters running past the player seemingly
  oblivious to their existence.
- Pacifist: Added to the Hard spawn list!
  
MAP CHANGES:
- Made some tweaks to IWAD maps (E1M8, MAP01, MAP02, MAP32)

BUILD 03 (December 18th 2019)
=============================

MONSTER CHANGES:
- General: Monsters can now trigger "Sector Action: Actor Hits Floor" actors that
  are set up to be effected by players, since these are commonly used to kill or
  teleport players that go out of bounds. This is togglable in the DM Sim menu.

- Removed duplicate Rocket Launcher sprites.

  teleporting instead of respawning.

GAMEPLAY CHANGES:
